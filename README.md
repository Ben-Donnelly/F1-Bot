# F1-Bot

### In Progress
- Get a feel for the API and its capabilities

### Tasks
- Optimise return values with a toString() def maybe
- Optimise methods to call similar endpoints (e.g. constructor_standings_after_a_race)
  * This can have a round or not, code for this is complete (for now) do for others where possible
  * Also current_drivers_standings() and current_constructors_standings() are very similar, could optimise to 1 function
- Tests
- Make bot

### Done âœ“
