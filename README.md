# F1-Bot

### In Progress
- Get a feel for the API and its capabilities
- Tests
- Expand validate function
- Map drivers names to codes in dict
  * I dont want to hard code this so I dont have to do this every year

### Tasks
- Look at using Json instead
- Optimise methods to call similar endpoints (e.g. constructor_standings_after_a_race)
  * This can have a round or not, code for this is complete (for now) do for others where possible
  * Also current_drivers_standings() and current_constructors_standings() are very similar, could optimise to 1 function
- Classes for each section (e.g results, standings, finishing status etc.)
- Look into mocking for tests
- Make bot

### Done âœ“
- Optimise return values with a toString() def maybe
